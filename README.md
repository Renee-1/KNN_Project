# KNN_Project
- Standardize the variables from Scikit learn. 
- Generated a KNN Model by selecting the best K value using a plot of 'Error Rate vs. K Value' . 
- Achieved a precision and recall score of 0.86 and 0.85 respectively
# About Algorithm
KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) is a classification algorithm
### Training Algorithm
- Store all the Data
### Prediction Algorithm
- Calculate the distance from x to all points in the data
- Sort the points in the data by increasing distance from x
- Predict the majority label of the "k" closest points
Note: Choosing a K will affect what class a new point in assigned to
